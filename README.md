# Thermocouple-Test-Board
Uses both the MCP9801 and MCP3425 onboard temperature sensor and 16 bit ADC to read a thermocouple

Parts list is self explanatory. MCP9801 temp sensor and MCP3425 SOT ADC. The 16bit or 18 bit versions should work. 

C3 and C4 are 4.7uF to 10uF

C1 and C2 are 0.1uF or lesser to help filter out the input.

JP1 is a standard 2.54mm screw terminal block. J2 is 2.54mm pins.

R1 and R2 are 4.7k ohm resistors.
